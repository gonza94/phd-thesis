\chapter{Single Particle Dynamics}
The most basic element of a particle accelerator can be thought of as a black box. This black box takes some initial transverse coordinates $x_0,x'_0,y_0,y'_0$, as defined in a Frenet-Serret coordinate system, and maps them to some final coordinates $x_f,x'_f,y_f,y'_f$. For simplicity, any longitudinal effect will not be taken into account for this analysis \cite{rr1} \cite{rr2} \cite{wolski} \cite{pipII1}.
