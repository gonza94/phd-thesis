\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:ch1}
 
Particle accelerators are the workhorses for modern scientific discoveries. Experimental nuclear and particle physics research benefit greatly from the progress of accelerator physics and technology. Accelerator physics is a rich field of applied physics living on the intersection of electromagnetism, solid-state and atomic physics, nonlinear mechanics, plasma physics, quantum mechanics, just to name a few \cite{sylee}. Furthermore, the design and operation of modern accelerator projects require costly enterprises of scientists, engineers, operators, and politicians coming together under one single metaphorical roof.         

\section{Circular Accelerators and Storage Rings}

As will become more apparent on Ch. \ref{sec:ch2}, a particle accelerator can be thought of as a composition of accelerator-themed LEGO® bricks \cite{forest}. Each elemental LEGO® brick can be thought of as an accelerator component performing some mapping on the charged particles entering it. As it turns out, these LEGO® bricks can be assembled together in a circular fashion to give rise to circular accelerators. For the case where particles are not accelerated on these structures, a storage ring arises.     

\section{Fermilab}

The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), better known as Fermilab, has a long and rich history of designing, building and operating high-energy particle accelerators. Ever since the founding director of Fermilab, Robert R. Wilson, envisioned the 400 GeV Main Ring back in 1967, Fermilab has been at the forefront of accelerator physics.     \cite{tevatron},\cite{fermilab1}

\section{Outline}

The following thesis will explore the compensation of third-order resonances in the Fermilab Recycler Ring. This \hyperref[sec:ch1]{first chapter} introduces the motivation behind this thesis work. The \hyperref[sec:ch2]{second chapter} summarizes single particle dynamics with the help of exponential Lie operators and moves forward to introduce a relevant concept of collective beam dynamics: the space charge tune shift. This theoretical overview gives segue into the \hyperref[sec:ch3]{third chapter} of this thesis, where the Recycler Ring is introduced and described in detail. Motivation for the compensation of third order resonances is given in this chapter under the framework of current and future operation of the RR. With the basic physics concepts and the description of the machine put in place, the \hyperref[sec:ch4]{fourth chapter} describes in full detail the scheme and experiments developed in order to compensate third order resonances at low intensities. Before moving to explore the Recycler Ring at high intensities, \hyperref[sec:ch5]{chapter five} provides an interlude in order to show a series of experiments done at the CERN PS Booster. These experiments explore the use of advanced optimization algorithms in the aid of compensating multiple resonance lines simultaneously. Coming back to Fermilab, \hyperref[sec:ch6]{chapter six} showcases the studies and experiments done at high intensities in the RR in order to understand the interplay between the compensation of resonance lines and space charge effects. Finally, \hyperref[sec:ch7]{chapter seven} brings down the curtain by providing some general conclusions and future work stemming from this thesis.
