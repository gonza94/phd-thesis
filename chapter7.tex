\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{RDTs and Resonance Compensation}

The measurement and subsequent cancellation of RDTs was investigated in depth in Ch. \ref{sec:ch4}. It was shown that third order RDTs in the Recycler Ring can be measured and, afterwards, cancelled with the compensation sextupoles in place. Furthermore, optimization procedures have been developed in order to have this compensation   

\subsection{Physics-Informed vs. Optimization-Based Compensation}

Chapters \ref{sec:ch4} and \ref{sec:ch5} showed two different approaches to the same problem of resonance compensation. The first one performed at the Fermilab Recycler Ring showed how to implement the response matrix approach, which can be traced to some underlying physics principles. On the other hand, Ch. \ref{sec:ch5} shows how to implement numerical optimization algorithms for compensating multiple resonance lines at the CERN PS Booster. Nevertheless, this last approach had no direct physics input. The distinction between a physics-informed approach and a numerical-optimization approach summarizes the differences between both chapters. The 

\subsection{High-Intensity Resonance Compensation}

For current operations of the Fermilab Accelerator Complex, the third-order resonance compensation scheme developed in this work will not have an effect on reducing losses in the Recycler Ring. The current tune spreads in the RR are not large enough for the third order resonances to be specially harmful to operations. The beam coming out of Booster grows exponentially with the beam intensity, as it was shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tunespread}. Thus, saturating the tune spread at values close to 0.02---not particularly large. The losses in the Recycler Ring are purely emittance-dominated for current operations. They are not related to space charge effects. Nonetheless, the resonance compensation scheme still is beneficial to operations at high intensities. This is if the operational tune is moved closer to the third order resonance lines, which is not suggested.  

\subsection{Transverse Dampers and High-Intensity Compensation}

Section \ref{sec:ch6dampers} showed how the transverse dampers have an effect on the resonance compensation scheme. Figure \ref{fig:dampers7} reinforces this statement by showing the beam survival ratio at a high intensity of 4.5e10 ppb without compensation and dampers on(bare machine), with compensation and dampers on, and with compensation and dampers off. Ultimately, the dampers degrade the quality of the compensation. In particular, when turned off, the overall beam survival ratio increases. The configuration of the dampers---gain and phase of feedback---has been optimized away from the resonance lines. When the tunes are set close to the third order resonance lines, the dampers settings will create beam size growth. They are not optimized to run in this region, and will cause harmful effects on the beam, even with the resonance compensation scheme enabled.

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Verification of Newly-Installed Sextupoles}

Section \ref{sec:compensate} explained the motivation behind installing additional sextupoles that would bring down that currents needed to compensate $3Q_x=76$ and $Q_x+ 2Q_y = 74$. Subsequently, Sec. \ref{sec:addsexts} explained the procedure used in order to pin down the new locations for two new compensation sextupoles. There is still future work to be done regarding the commissioning and connection of the new 620 sextupoles. The sextupoles and their power supplies need to be interfaced with ACNET. Furthermore, the resonance compensation enhancement still needs to verified by means of performing an RDT scan. Specifically, the response matrix coefficients corresponding to these new sextupoles need to be measured and calculated. All of this, following the procedure outlined in Secs. \ref{sec:rdtmeasure} and \ref{sec:compensate}. Figure \ref{fig:new620sexts} shows a picture of the newly installed sextupoles.

\subsection{Resonances and Transverse Dampers at High Intensities}

It was shown in Sec. \ref{sec:ch6dampers} that the transverse dampers in the Recycler Ring can interact with betatron resonance lines depending on their configuration. It would be interesting to perform experiments with the configuration of these dampers in order to fully characterize these effects. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to use the dampers as anti-dampers in order to sustain betatron oscillations. With this configuration, one could perform tune measurements, and perhaps evaluate this alternative method to measure RDTs. This would be similar to having an AC dipole installed in the Recycler.  

\subsection{Effect of MI Ramp on RDTs}

The ultimate objective of this work is to have this resonance compensation scheme fully characterized in order to incorporate it into high intensity operations. Nevertheless, there is one additional factor that has been identified to also play a role in this effort. This one stems from the fact that the Main Injector and the Recycler Ring share the same tunnel. It has been shown that the acceleration ramp changes the beam dynamics inside the Recycler Ring. In particular, it introduces orbit distortions and tune shifts depending on the position of the ramp \cite{mionrr}. There is an ongoing effort in order to characterize any higher order magnetic effect from the MI to RR, e.g., any sextupole term that is being introduced by the MI acceleration ramp. The first results have shown that the compensation currents change depending on the location of the study event with respect to the MI acceleration ramp. Therefore, in the future, the resonance compensation described hereinabove should be modified to accommodate this effect to be fully operational.

\subsection{Limits of Resonance Compensation}

\subsection{Space Charge RDTs}

Equation \ref{eq:hfinal} shows how the lattice elements and the space charge potential drive betatron resonances. It would be interesting to explore further how to measure space charge resonance driving terms (SCRDTs) and their effect on the operation of the Recycler Ring. Without taking into account any collective instabilities, the ultimate limit of the Recycler Ring will be dictated by how strong these third order lines become in the space-charge dominated regime. The current future of the Main Injector and Recycler Ring lies in high-intensity beam. As the space charge potential grows for the Fermilab beams, it is important to quantify all effects from high intensity operation---being SCRDTs one of them.
