This book is the first history of this laboratory and of its powerful accelerators told from the point of view of the people who built and used them for scientific discovery. Focusing on the first two decades of research at Fermilab, during the tenure of the laboratory's charismatic first two directors, Robert R. Wilson and Leon M. Lederman, the book traces the rise of what they call “megascience”, the collaborative struggle to conduct large-scale international experiments in a climate of limited federal funding. In the midst of this new climate, this book illuminates the growth of the modern research laboratory during the Cold War and captures the drama of human exploration at the cutting edge of science.}",

PIP-II is an integral part of the strategic plan for U.S. High Energy Physics as described in the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) report of May 2014 and formalized through the Mission Need Statement approved in November 2015. As an immediate goal, PIP-II is focused on upgrades to the Fermilab accelerator complex capable of providing proton beam power in excess of 1 MW on target at the initiation of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (LBNF/DUNE) program, currently anticipated for the mid- 2020s. PIP-II is a part of a longer-term goal of establishing a high-intensity proton facility that is unique within the world, ultimately leading to multi-MW capabilities at Fermilab....},

  abstract     = {{The Recycler and Main Injector are part of the Fermilab Accelerator complex used to deliver a high power proton beam. Both machines share the same enclosure with the Recycler mounted 6 ft above the Main Injector. The Main Injector accelerates beam from 8 GeV to 120 GeV. While the majority of the Recycler has mu metal shielding, the effect of the Main Injector ramp is still significant and can affect both the tunes and the orbit. In this paper, we detail the size of these effects.}},
