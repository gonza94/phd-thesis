This book is the first history of this laboratory and of its powerful accelerators told from the point of view of the people who built and used them for scientific discovery. Focusing on the first two decades of research at Fermilab, during the tenure of the laboratory's charismatic first two directors, Robert R. Wilson and Leon M. Lederman, the book traces the rise of what they call “megascience”, the collaborative struggle to conduct large-scale international experiments in a climate of limited federal funding. In the midst of this new climate, this book illuminates the growth of the modern research laboratory during the Cold War and captures the drama of human exploration at the cutting edge of science.}",

title = {Fermilab Antiproton source, Recycler ring and Main Injector},
author = {Nagaitsev, S.},
abstractNote = {The antiproton source for a proton-antiproton collider at Fermilab was proposed in 1976 [1]. The proposal argued that the requisite luminosity (~1029 cm-2sec-1) could be achieved with a facility that would produce and cool approximately 1011 antiprotons per day. Funding for the Tevatron I project (to construct the Antiproton source) was initiated in 1981 and the Tevatron ring itself was completed, as a fixed target accelerator, in the summer of 1983 and the Antiproton Source was completed in 1985. At the end of its operations in 2011, the Fermilab antiproton production complex consisted of a sophisticated target system, three 8-GeV storage rings (namely the Debuncher, Accumulator and Recycler), 25 independent multi-GHz stochastic cooling systems, the world’s only relativistic electron cooling system and a team of technical experts equal to none. Sustained accumulation of antiprotons was possible at the rate of greater than 2.5×1011 per hour. Record-size stacks of antiprotons in excess of 3×1012 were accumulated in the Accumulator ring and 6×1012 in the Recycler. In some special cases, the antiprotons were stored in rings for more than 50 days. Note, that over the years, some 1016 antiprotons were produced and accumulated at Fermilab, which is about 17 nanograms and more than 90\% of the world’s total man-made quantity of nuclear antimatter. The accelerator complex at Fermilab supported a broad physics program including the Tevatron Collider Run II [2], neutrino experiments using 8 GeV and 120 GeV proton beams, as well as a test beam facility and other fixed target experiments using 120 GeV primary proton beams. The following sections provide a brief description of Fermilab accelerators as they operated at the end of the Collider Run II (2011).},

abstract = {The Fermilab accelerator complex delivers intense high-energy proton beams to a variety of fixed-target scientific programs, including a flagship long-baseline neutrino program. With the advent of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) program there is strong motivation for a 2.4 MW beam power upgrade of the Fermilab proton facility. We show the Fermilab proton facility can achieve 2.4 MW with a new rapid-cycling synchrotron (RCS) to replace the Fermilab Booster and we provide a comprehensive technical analysis of the RCS-based facility design. Past design efforts and operational experience at the Fermilab Booster, J-PARC RCS, and Oak Ridge SNS are leveraged to provide strong empirical precedent for the design. We provide a parametric study of slip-stacking accumulation, RCS extraction energy, space-charge limits, beampipe aperture, eddy current heating, injection foil heating, and lattice optics. The 2.4 MW benchmark for the long baseline neutrino program is achieved independently of a previously proposed multi-GeV linac program, but we assess the impact the linac upgrade would have on RCS performance.}
