\section{\label{sec:intro31}Introduction}
The Fermilab Recycler Ring (RR) is one of the circular accelerators located in the Fermilab Accelerator Complex. It was originally designed to store and accumulate antiprotons that remained from a Tevatron event \cite{rr0}. The recycling of antiprotons was deemed ineffective and was never operationally implemented \cite{rrnagaitsev}. Since 2011, the RR has been repurposed as a pre-injector to the Main Injector (MI) by storing and accumulating protons \cite{rr1}. It is worth pointing out that the MI and the RR share the same tunnel, with a circumference of 3.319 km (2.062 mi). The work done for this thesis focuses on the Recycler Ring. The following chapter starts by giving a general description of the operation and physics of the Recycler Ring. The following sections introduce and motivate the compensation of third-order resonances for high-intensity operation.  

The MI/RR complex is fed protons by the Proton Source, which by itself consists of the Pre-Accelerator, the Linear Accelerator (Linac), and the Booster. The Pre-Accelerator systems provide $H^-$ ions to the Linac, where they are accelerated to an energy of 400 MeV. After this, the beam is injected into the Booster Ring. The Booster is a rapid-cycling synchrotron operating at a 15 Hz repetition rate. During this injection process, the $H^-$ beam passes through a carbon stripping foil and incorporates into the circulating proton beam. The Booster ramps the energy up from 400 MeV to 8 GeV. This 8 GeV proton beam can either go to the Booster Neutrino Experiments or get injected into the Recycler Ring. Once in RR, the beam has two possible destinations: 1) high-energy neutrino experiments through MI or 2) Muon Campus. For the latter, the proton beam gets rebunched from 53 MHz to 2.5 MHz and transported to the Muon Campus. The proton beam gets slip-stacked for high-energy neutrino experiments, doubling the intensity injected into the Main Injector. Once in MI, the beam is accelerated to 120 GeV and sent to the NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam facility \cite{rr1, rrnagaitsev, numi1}. Figure \ref{fig:fnal} describes the current accelerator complex, including the experimental beamlines that feed neutrino, muon, and fixed target experiments.

The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) is the first step in establishing the Fermilab Accelerator Complex as a multi-MW proton facility \cite{pipII1}. The near-future objective is to deliver a 1.2 MW proton beam to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) through the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) \cite{dune}, still in construction. In order to meet this goal, Fermilab is planning several upgrades in the accelerator complex, including a new 800 MeV superconducting linear accelerator. The plan for the layout of the Fermilab Accelerator Complex is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fnalpip2}. With minimal upgrades to the Main Injector and Recycler Ring but a substantial overhaul of the Booster Ring, this will allow for a 50\% increase in particles per pulse intensity. Table \ref{tab:rrparams} also specifies some upgrades that will happen for the PIP-II era. Some examples include an increase of the particle per bunch intensity, a shortening of the Main Injector acceleration ramp, and an increase in the Booster ramping rate. As the Recycler Ring starts to deal with higher intensities from the PIP-II upgrade, it is important to mitigate the effects of space charge, as discussed in Secs. \ref{sec:resonances} and \ref{sec:sc1}. Particles along the bunch will experience space charge forces leading to detuning in their betatron frequencies. Given the incoherent nature of this process, this leads to the beam having a larger tune spread in the tune diagram and having particles operate on top of resonances.

\section{\label{sec:rrgen}General Description}

The RR is a permanent magnet storage ring operating at a fixed momentum of 8.835 GeV/c, equivalent to an energy of 8 GeV. The basic cell structures of this machine are FODO (Focusing Quadrupole - Drift - Defocusing Quadrupole - Drift) cells. During its conception, the need for a quick and non-expensive design spurred the idea of combining quadrupole and dipole magnets into one combined function magnet. Figure \ref{fig:rrtunnel} shows these combined function magnets as the green-covered magnets on the top ring---the Recycler Ring. In order to further reduce costs during its construction, these magnets were chosen to be permanent magnets made out of a strontium ferrite \cite{rr0}. One advantage of having permanent magnets is that there is no need for power supplies, cooling systems, or power distribution cables. Consequently, these types of magnets are very stable against time and temperature. Nevertheless, the magnetic field of such magnets does degrade over time. Reference \cite{rr1} shows how the fields in RR-type magnets can degrade around 1\% after 20 years. Ultimately, this slightly changes the nominal energy in the machine. 

\begin{figure}[H]

   \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{chapter3/tunnel.jpg}
   \caption{Picture of the Main Injector (blue and red magnets in the bottom) and the Recycler Ring (green magnets up top) tunnel.}
   \label{fig:rrtunnel}
   \vspace{-1.25em}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rrtunnel} reminds the reader that the Main Injector and the Recycler Ring share the same tunnel. This tunnel is divided into six sections with labels: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600. Injection from the Booster Ring into the Recycler takes place just after the beginning of section 100. Specifically, this happens at a Lambertson magnet labeled as LAM102. This case is just an example of how every RR or MI element will be labeled according to its position in one of these sections. Figure \ref{fig:rrschematic} shows a schematic of the Recycler Ring section with some labels for critical subsystems inside them. In particular, it shows the location close to 232, where the beam is transferred from the Recycler Ring to the Main Injector. Figure \ref{fig:rrschematic} also presents the location in section 500 where the beam is transferred from RR to the Muon Campus, as well as the location after 401 where the beam is dumped towards the abort line \cite{rr1,fermi_rookie}.

As highlighted in Fig. \ref{fig:rrschematic}, a critical subsystem is the tune trombone. The RR has two of them, one in sections 601-609 and another in 301-309. A tune or phase trombone is a linear insert composed of quadrupoles introducing local phase advances. These quadrupoles are powered to add a controlled phase advance while leaving the Twiss parameters unchanged at the end of the insert and matched to the start of the trombone \cite{trombone,rr0}. Ultimately, these subsystems introduce local tune changes that allow the control of both tunes in a $\pm 0.5$ range, i.e., $\Delta Q_u = \pm 0.5$. The Recycler Ring has accelerator applications through ACNET that allow the control of these tune trombones and set the tunes to some desired values. Furthermore, this application allows tune ramps and continuous linear changes in the tunes. This feature is crucial for building dynamic loss maps---an important tool to probe resonance lines as will be described in Sec. \ref{sec:lossmaps}.

\end{figure}

The Recycler Ring has 104 FODO cells distributed into three main groups around its 3319.4-meter circumference \cite{rr0}. The first group of cells comprises two permanent magnet quadrupoles arranged so that each cell has a phase advance of 90$^{\circ}$. There are 18 cells of this first group throughout the Recycler. The second group comprises a cell with two combined function magnets to simultaneously bend and focus the beam. This type of cell also has a phase advance of 90$^{\circ}$, with 54 cells of this type in the RR. Ultimately, the configuration of these cells will dictate the Twiss parameters around the ring. Figure \ref{fig:rrbetas} shows the beta functions $\beta_u(s)$ around the Recycler Ring tuned to some particular set of tunes. Some horizontal BPMs are marked in the upper horizontal axis to note the corresponding section in the tunnel.    

Before describing the third group, it is worth clarifying to the reader that the transverse motion inside any circular accelerator is dictated by:
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:utotal}
   u(s) = u_{\beta}(s) + D_u(s) \delta,
\end{equation}
where $u$ is either the $x$ or $y$ plane, $u_{\beta}(s)$ is the betatron motion as described by Eq. \ref{eq:betatron}, $D_u(s)$ is known as the dispersion function and $\delta=\Delta p/p_0$ is the fractional momentum deviation of an individual particle with respect to the reference longitudinal momentum $p_0$. In Ch. \ref{sec:ch2}, specifically in Sec. \ref{sec:lie}, an assumption was made that the transverse coordinates were not going to be influenced by any longitudinal property, focusing on on-momentum particles, i.e., $\delta =0$. Nevertheless, for this section, it is relevant to introduce the dispersion function $D_u(s)$ to describe the Recycler Ring in all its glory and detail. The dispersion function depends on the distribution of quadrupole and dipole components throughout the ring \cite{sylee}. Even so, the scope of this work regarding resonance compensation will not consider any longitudinal-transverse coupling.   

With all this said, the third group comprises special dispersion suppressor cells, $D_x(s)=0$ for these regions. Each one has two combined function magnets and globally has a betatron phase advance of again 90$^{\circ}$. This cell type will allow dispersion-free regions necessary for the Recycler's injection, extraction, and other particular subsystems. There are 32 cells of this type. Figure \ref{fig:rrdisps} shows the dispersion functions for the Recycler Ring. Thanks to this third type of FODO cells, the horizontal dispersion function $D_x(s)$ has regions of close-to-zero values. The vertical dispersion is negligible, i.e., $D_y(s)\approx 0$.

The ultimate role of the Recycler Ring is to smooth the way for high-intensity proton beam injection into the Main Injector. In particular, for the high-intensity beam delivered to the neutrino experiments, the Recycler performs a beam manipulation known as slip-stacking. Although this longitudinal manipulation is out of the main scope of this thesis, it is relevant to briefly explain this procedure since this is the Recycler Ring's main feature. Slip-stacking is the process through which a pair of bunches are manipulated in longitudinal phase space to merge them into one higher-intensity bunch \cite{fermi_rookie}. In particular, the RR utilizes two RF stations to decelerate and accelerate trains of bunches. The Recycler can fit 7 Booster Rings. Hence, 6+6 beam batches are injected and slip-stacked, while 1 batch space is left as a gap for the kickers to fire. Each batch is composed of 81 bunches following the harmonic number of the Recycler. A more detailed explanation of the Recycler Ring's slip-stacking procedure can be found in Refs. \cite{rr1,rr2,fermi_rookie}. Ultimately, this slip-stacking process is relevant because it doubles the particles per bunch intensity (ppb), which has significant consequences for the transverse dynamics, as explained in Sec. \ref{sec:sc1}. Furthermore, Table \ref{tab:rrparams} summarizes some important parameters for the RR slip-stacking and the general operation of the neutrino-bound beam.

\section{Tune Diagram and Resonances}

Table \ref{tab:rrparams} specifies nominal horizontal and vertical tunes for the operation of the Recycler Ring. While this pair of tunes can be switched around during operation to reduce losses, they will always stay clear of the surrounding transverse betatron resonances, as introduced in Sec. \ref{sec:resonances}. Figure \ref{fig:rrtd} plots the resonance lines relevant to the Recycler Ring operation, with their corresponding order in the multipole expansion. Specifically, this study looks at normal sextupole lines $3 Q_x=76$ and $Q_x+2Q_y=74$, plus skew sextupole lines $3 Q_y=73$ and $2 Q_x+Q_y=75$.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{chapter3/rrtd.png}
   \caption{Portion of the tune diagram enclosing the operational tunes of the Recycler Ring.}
   \label{fig:rrtd}
   \vspace{-1.25em}
\end{figure}

Starting from the lowest order resonance line, Fig. \ref{fig:rrtd} shows the second-order linear coupling line $Q_x-Q_y = 1$. This resonance line comes from the skew-quadrupole component accumulated all around the ring. While operating on this resonance line will not lead to chaotic motion, the dynamics are characterized by action exchange between the betatron modes \cite{sylee}. This exchange can cause emittance growth, eventually leading to beam loss. Due to this fact, the Recycler Ring has two families of skew quadrupoles, which correct this resonance line. Consequently, operating close to this resonance line is feasible with this correction.

The third-order resonance lines are the main focus of this thesis. They are driven by normal- and skew-sextupole components distributed around the ring. In particular, it is known that the combined function magnets are the main drivers of these resonance lines. Even though these magnets were designed to be quadrupole and dipole only, they can still have sextupole components from construction errors. Nevertheless, since they are permanent magnets, little can be done about the magnets themselves. As a result, the following work explores a compensation technique to bring down the lattice RDTs that drive these resonance lines. A summary of the RDTs, their corresponding resonance line, and the frequency position of their spectral lines are summarized in Table \ref{tab:rdtlines}. The spectral lines are a concept critical to the measurement of RDTs, and it is introduced in the next chapter. The compensation of these RDTs involves the usage of additional compensation sextupoles. Section \ref{sec:css} describes these elements. Chapter \ref{sec:ch4} goes into a deep dive explaining this approach from a theoretical and experimental point of view. 

\begin{table}[H]

   \caption{Corresponding RDTs and location of spectral lines for each resonance line.}

       \midrule
           $3Q_x=76$     & Normal Sextupole    & $h_{3000}$           &  (-2,0)  & -       \\ %[3pt]
          $Q_x+2Q_y=74$   & Normal Sextupole    & $h_{1020}$            & (0,-2) & (-1,-1)       \\ %[3pt]
           $3Q_y=73$     & Skew Sextupole   & $h_{0030}$           & - & (0,-2)        \\ %[3pt]
           $2Q_x+Q_y=75$   & Skew Sextupole    & $h_{2010}$     & (-1,-1) & (-2,0)       \\
       \bottomrule
   \end{tabular}
   \label{tab:rdtlines}
\end{table}

Finally, there are also fourth-order resonance lines close to the nominal operation of the Recycler. Octupole components around the ring drive these lines. In practice, $-Q_x+3Q_y = 48$ and $3Q_x-Q_y = 52$ are not particularly concerning to the operation of the RR. Their corresponding lattice RDTs are not large enough to consider them dangerous during the RR cycle, i.e., the beam is stored for approximately 1 second. Nevertheless, these lines are interesting because fourth-order resonance lines are susceptible to being amplified by the space charge potential through the SCRDTs, as described in Sec. \ref{sec:sc1}.    

\section{High Intensity and Tune Footprint}

In order to achieve the PIP-II beam power objective, the Recycler will be required to store and accumulate 50\% more beam than current operations \cite{pipII1}. As explained in Sec. \ref{sec:sc1}, larger beam intensities lead to larger space charge tune spread. Figure \ref{fig:rrtdhigh} shows how, for the typical operation to the neutrino experiments under future PIP-II specifications, there is a space charge tune spread of around 0.1 in both planes. At nominal tunes, it is clear that for high-intensity operation, the particles in the core of the beam will start to operate on top of third-order resonances. One feature further complicates this picture: particles will undergo synchrotron oscillations within the diamond-shaped region. Particles will go from the core of the beam to its outskirts, and its incoherent space charge tune shift will fluctuate accordingly. Therefore, particles will cross in and out of these third-order resonances at a synchrotron period. Ultimately, Fig. \ref{fig:rrtdhigh} just tries to take a snapshot of the region of these excursions.  

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{chapter3/rrtdhigh.png}
   \caption{Approximate operational tune footprint at high intensities, i.e., 1e11 particles per bunch.}
   \label{fig:rrtdhigh}
   \vspace{-1.25em}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rrtdhigh} and the latter discussion motivate the need for mitigating the deleterious effects of $3 Q_x=76$ and $Q_x+2Q_y=74$, and weaker effects from $3 Q_y=73$ and $2 Q_x+Q_y=75$. If one reduces the RDT of each resonance line, then their strength becomes less, losses in those regions are reduced, and ultimately there will be a larger area in the tune diagram for operation. This mechanism is desirable for PIP-II. Nevertheless, Ch. \ref{sec:ch4} describes compensating one resonance line might make another one worse and vice versa. Here lies the difficulty of this approach. Additionally, these third-order resonance lines must be adequately characterized at low intensities before going to PIP-II intensities. Experimentally, everything starts to blend together in the tune diagram at high intensities due to the space charge tune shift. This amalgam of phenomena motivates the fact to have a distinction between Ch. \ref{sec:ch4} and \ref{sec:ch6}.    

\section{\label{sec:diagnostic}Diagnostic Devices}

The Recycler Ring has two primary diagnostic devices that fall under the scope of this work: the Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) and the Ion Profile Monitors (IPMs). Although both systems quantify the properties of the beam, each one gives different information about the beam distribution. In particular, BPMs probe the first moment of the transverse distribution, i.e., the bunch's mean position or beam centroid. Depending on the BPM system, this measurement is done in one plane or simultaneously in both planes. On the other hand, IPMs go one order higher and give information about the second-order moment of the transverse beam distribution---information about the variance and spread of the bunch. Specifically for the Recycler case, there is one IPM for the horizontal direction and another for the vertical case.

There are 208 BPMs in the Recycler Ring in total. Specifically, there are 104 horizontal BPMs and 104 vertical BPMs. Each class is oriented in order to measure the corresponding plane. The BPMs are labeled according to their position around the ring as described in Sec. \ref{sec:rrgen} and in Fig. \ref{fig:rrschematic}. One BPM consists of two parallel pick-up electrodes that produce an electric signal once the beam passes. The beam position is determined from the relative amplitude between the signals of the opposing channels \cite{rrbpms}---also known as the $(A-B)/(A+B)$ signal. This signal is digitized and calibrated to include the scaling factors and offsets, ultimately, in order to represent the transverse beam position. The digitized signal from all 208 BPMs is interfaced with ACNET for accelerator applications. The resulting data is digitized every turn, which is called turn-by-turn (TbT) data. Figure \ref{fig:bpmkick} shows an example of this TbT BPM data for a beam pinged in the horizontal direction and recorded for 2048 turns.      

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{chapter3/bpm_kick.png}
   \caption{BPM turn-by-turn data for an arbitrary kick at horizontal BPM R:HP620.}
   \label{fig:bpmkick}
   \vspace{-1.25em}
\end{figure}

One important example of using TbT data is using it to perform tune measurements. As mentioned in Sec. \ref{sec:basic}, specifically in Eq. \ref{eq:betatron}, the motion inside the Recycler Ring will exhibit betatron oscillations. In particular, the tune frequency dictates the main harmonic of these oscillations. Say a particular set of BPM TbT data has been recorded for $N$ number of turns. Therefore, a Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) will help uncover and measure FFT accuracy---$\sigma_Q\approx 1/N $---the main frequency of these oscillations. Figure \ref{fig:bpmfft} shows how the prominent peak of the FFT can be identified to measure the horizontal tune $Q_x$ of the circular accelerator. Furthermore, Ch. \ref{sec:ch4} will explore how a more involved Fourier Transform algorithm, such as NAFF (Numerical Analysis of Fundamental Frequencies) \cite{naff}, will help analyze the spectrum of TbT data and measure higher order harmonics, ultimately, leading to the measurement of RDTs in the RR.     

\begin{figure}[H]

The second type of diagnostics relevant to this work are the Ion Profile Monitors (IPMs). As mentioned before, this device measures the beam size in the Recycler Ring. The RR has two IPM systems: one for the horizontal plane and another one for the vertical. One unique characteristic of IPMs relies on their non-destructive nature. The working principle of this system is to collect ions created in the interaction between the proton beam and residual molecules in the vacuum. Micro-channel plates (MCP) detect the secondary ions and are biased at an arbitrary high voltage \cite{betiay}. The counts at each MCP are logged in and digitized to be compatible with ACNET. Similar to the BPM systems, an application was developed to control and use the IPM system.

Figure \ref{fig:ipm0} shows the reconstruction of the horizontal beam profile from the raw data of the IPM micro-channel plates. At every turn, the raw count data from each of the 96 MCP is fit to Gaussian beam distribution, resulting in some variance $\sigma$. The color map shows the evolution of this beam profile along 1024 turns. The IPM system can record up to 65000 turns. Nevertheless, it batches the data into a $1024 \times 96$ array. In particular, Fig. \ref{fig:ipm0} shows how, for these arbitrary experimental conditions, the size of the beam grows with the number of turns---this is pointing at emittance growth. Other distributions different from a Gaussian can be used to fit the raw data to extract more information about the skewness or tail population of the beam, e.g., a q-Gaussian or a Skew-Gaussian distribution. In particular, Ch. \ref{sec:ch6} shows how to use q-Gaussian distributions to quantify beam tail population.

\section{\label{sec:css}Sextupoles for Resonance Compensation}

The ideal linear lattice of a circular accelerator would be composed only of dipoles and quadrupoles---assuming the beam is composed of mono-energetic particles. Nevertheless, this is a strong assumption, given that a bunch of particles will always have an energy spread. Particles orbiting at different energies will feel different quadrupole fields, resulting in betatron detuning. This wording is the definition of chromaticity, and therefore, its mathematical definition reads:
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:chrom}
   C_u=\frac{d \left( \Delta Q_u \right)}{d \delta}.
\end{equation}    

Every real ring will have a non-zero chromaticity. Sextupoles are crucial to control and correct chromaticity \cite{sylee}. Therefore, they are indispensable in any lattice. Nevertheless, as explained in Ch. \ref{sec:ch2}, introducing non-linear elements inevitably leads to driving betatron resonances, e.g., sextupoles will drive third-order resonances. In this sense, and dramatically speaking, sextupoles are double-edged swords. They are essential for chromaticity correction but deleterious by inducing resonances in the accelerator.

The Recycler Ring has 76 sextupoles, including normal and skew sextupoles. Additionally, as described in Sec. \ref{sec:rrgen}, each gradient magnet has end shims on both ends and is used to correct the field shape \cite{meiqin2}. These end shims can also induce a sextupole-like field on the beam. It is also worth reminding the reader that the gradient magnets also have sextupole components in their permanent fields. All of these build up to the fact that the chromaticity of the Recycler Ring can be controlled in a range of -2 to -20 in both planes, i.e., $Q_u\in (-2, -20)$.    

\begin{table}[H]

In particular, out of all the sextupoles in the Recycler Ring, this thesis work is interested in the ones listed in Table \ref{tab:sextscomp}. These elements have been placed in the Recycler Ring with the sole objective of mitigating the harmful effect of the third-order resonances \cite{rr2}. The elements listed in Table \ref{tab:sextscomp} are in regions of close-to-zero dispersion, $D_x \approx 0$, to cancel out any additional chromaticity due to their inclusion. In principle, normal sextupoles are used to correct $3Q_x=76$ and $Q_x+2Q_y=74$, while skew sextupoles are used to correct $3Q_y=73$ and $2Q_x+Q_y=75$. Nevertheless, normal sextupoles can have small tilts around the magnetic axis, introducing a skew-sextupole field and vice versa.

Figure \ref{fig:sextupoles} shows an example of these sextupoles installed in the Recycler Ring. As can be seen, two yellow-coated elements appear in the top ring. The same power supply powers both elements. Hence, the notation in Table \ref{tab:sextscomp} alludes to a and b elements, e.g., normal sextupole SC220(a/b). The numbers in the name allude to their location in the RR/MI tunnel, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:rrschematic}. Given that each pair of elements, a and b, are connected to the same power supply, these two elements effectively become one knob. The currents for the power supply are controlled through ACNET. This concept is important for the reader to remember, given that in Ch. \ref{sec:ch4}, the currents of the sextupoles listed in Table \ref{tab:sextscomp} will be the main knobs turned in order to mitigate the strength of these resonances.
